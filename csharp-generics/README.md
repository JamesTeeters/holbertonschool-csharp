Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Introduction to Generics: This section provides an introduction to generics in C#. It covers the basics of generic classes, methods, and interfaces, and explains the benefits of using generics in your code.

Generic Collections: In this section, you will explore generic collections in C#. It covers commonly used generic collection types such as lists, dictionaries, queues, and stacks, and demonstrates how to work with them effectively.

Constraints on Generics: The Constraints on Generics section delves into applying constraints to generic type parameters. It covers constraints such as specifying base classes, interfaces, and value types for generic type arguments, enabling you to create more specific and type-safe code.

Building Reusable Code: This section focuses on using generics to build reusable code. It covers strategies for writing generic algorithms, creating generic utility classes, and designing generic interfaces that can be implemented by various types.

Each section includes examples, exercises, and best practices to reinforce the concepts covered and provide hands-on experience.
