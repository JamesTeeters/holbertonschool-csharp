C# Data Structures: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries
===============================================

This project focuses on learning about arrays, lists, and dictionaries in C# and how to effectively use them in your programs.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

### General

-   How to create and use arrays.
-   What are Collections in C#.
-   How to create and use lists.
-   The difference between arrays and lists in C#.
-   When to use an array vs a list.
-   How to create and use dictionaries.
-   The difference between dictionary and hashtables in C#.
-   When to use a dictionary vs a hashtable.
-   How to use the `foreach` loop.

Requirements
------------

### C# Tasks

-   Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code.
-   All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `dotnet`.
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
-   All default C# files named `Program.cs` should be renamed to the name given in each task.
-   You do not need to know about namespaces yet. Namespaces should be omitted in this project.
-   Each C# task requires its own folder and `.csproj` file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct.
-   You do not need to push your `obj/` or `bin/` folders.
-   In the examples provided, `main.cs` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repository. We will use our own `main.cs` files at compilation, which might be different from the ones shown in the examples.

Note: Read the `README.md` file in each task folder to understand the requirements and expected outcomes of each task.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and open it in Visual Studio Code. Each task has its own folder, and you can work on them independently. Use the provided examples and follow the instructions in each task's `README.md` file to complete the tasks.

Good luck with your learning journey!
