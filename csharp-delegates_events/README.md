C# - Delegates and Events
=========================

This repository contains a project focused on delegates and events in C#. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of delegates and events and their practical applications in event-driven programming. By exploring this project, you will gain valuable insights into how to implement event handling and create flexible and decoupled code using delegates and events.

Project Overview
----------------

The C# - Delegates and Events project covers the following key areas:

-   Understanding the concept and purpose of delegates in C#.
-   Implementing delegates to define callback methods and encapsulate functionality.
-   Working with events to create a pub/sub mechanism for event-driven programming.
-   Handling events and responding to actions or changes in the program.
-   Applying delegates and events in real-world scenarios and projects.

Through this project, you will gain practical knowledge and skills in leveraging delegates and events to build robust and responsive applications in C#.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By completing this project, you will be able to:

-   Understand the concept and purpose of delegates in C#.
-   Implement delegates to define callback methods and encapsulate functionality.
-   Work with events to create a pub/sub mechanism for event-driven programming.

Project Structure
-----------------

The project is structured as follows:

1.  Introduction to Delegates: This section provides an introduction to delegates in C#. It covers delegate declaration, instantiation, and invocation. You will learn how to define and use delegates to encapsulate and invoke methods with compatible signatures.

2.  Working with Events: In this section, you will explore events in C#. It covers event declaration, subscription, and invocation. You will learn how to define and raise events, as well as handle events in event-driven programming scenarios.

3.  Delegate and Event Examples: The Delegate and Event Examples section provides practical examples of using delegates and events in real-world scenarios. It covers topics such as event-driven user interfaces, asynchronous programming, and decoupling components through events.

Each section includes examples, exercises, and best practices to reinforce the concepts covered and provide hands-on experience.
