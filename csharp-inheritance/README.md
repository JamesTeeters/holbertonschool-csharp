C# - Inheritance
================

This repository contains a project focused on C# inheritance. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of inheritance in C# and its practical applications. By exploring this concept, you will gain valuable insights into how to effectively reuse and extend code in object-oriented programming.

Project Overview
----------------

The C# - Inheritance project covers the following key areas:

-   Understanding the concept of inheritance and its role in object-oriented programming.
-   Implementing inheritance to create derived classes that inherit from base classes.
-   Exploring the relationships between base classes and derived classes.
-   Working with constructors and initialization in inherited classes.
-   Overriding methods and properties in derived classes.
-   Utilizing polymorphism to create flexible and extensible code.

Through this project, you will gain practical knowledge and skills in designing and implementing inheritance hierarchies, enabling you to create well-structured and maintainable C# applications.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By completing this project, you will be able to:

-   Understand the concept and benefits of inheritance in object-oriented programming.
-   Implement inheritance to create derived classes that inherit behavior and characteristics from base classes.
-   Work with constructors in inherited classes and understand the initialization process.
-   Override methods and properties in derived classes to customize their behavior.
-   Utilize polymorphism to write code that can handle objects of different derived classes using a common base class interface.

Project Structure
-----------------

The project is structured as follows:

1.  Inheritance Basics: This section focuses on the fundamentals of inheritance in C#. It covers creating base classes, deriving classes, accessing base class members, and understanding the relationships between base and derived classes.

2.  Constructor Inheritance: In this section, you will explore how constructors are inherited and initialized in derived classes. It covers constructor chaining, base class constructors, and derived class constructors.

3.  Method Overriding and Polymorphism: The Method Overriding and Polymorphism section delves into overriding methods and properties in derived classes. It covers virtual and override keywords, polymorphism, and creating code that can handle objects of different derived classes using a common base class interface.

Each section includes examples and exercises to reinforce the concepts covered and provide hands-on experience.
