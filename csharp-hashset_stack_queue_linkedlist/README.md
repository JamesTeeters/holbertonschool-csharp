C# - Data Structures: HashSet, Stack, Queue, LinkedList
This repository contains a school project focused on implementing and utilizing various data structures in C# programming language. The project explores the HashSet, Stack, Queue, and LinkedList data structures, providing a comprehensive understanding of their functionalities and applications.

Project Overview
In this project, we will delve into the following data structures:

HashSet: A collection that stores unique elements, providing fast retrieval and efficient membership tests.
Stack: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection that allows adding and removing elements from the top.
Queue: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) collection that allows adding elements to the end and removing elements from the front.
LinkedList: A collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node, allowing efficient insertion and deletion operations.
By studying and implementing these data structures, you will gain valuable insights into their internal mechanisms and practical applications. Furthermore, you will improve your problem-solving skills and understand how to select the appropriate data structure for different scenarios.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will:

Understand the characteristics and advantages of HashSet, Stack, Queue, and LinkedList.
Implement these data structures using C# programming language.
Demonstrate proficiency in performing operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal on the data structures.
Analyze the time and space complexity of different operations for each data structure.
Apply the acquired knowledge to solve real-world problems and optimize code efficiency.
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

HashSet: This section focuses on implementing and utilizing the HashSet data structure. It includes examples and exercises to practice HashSet operations such as adding elements, checking membership, and performing set operations like intersection and union.

Stack: In this section, you will learn about the Stack data structure and its applications. It covers stack operations like push, pop, and peek, along with practical examples and exercises to reinforce the concepts.

Queue: The Queue section explores the Queue data structure and its usage scenarios. It provides an understanding of enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations, along with exercises to solidify your knowledge.

LinkedList: This section introduces the LinkedList data structure and its advantages over arrays and other data structures. It covers linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal, offering practical exercises to enhance your understanding.
