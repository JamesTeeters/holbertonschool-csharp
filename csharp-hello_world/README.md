C# Basics Project
=================

This project is designed to teach the basics of C# programming language. By the end of the project, you should be able to explain various concepts and perform tasks related to C# programming.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After completing this project, you should be able to:

-   Explain the meaning behind the name C# and who the lead architect of the development team is.
-   Describe what .NET is and the difference between C# and .NET.
-   Use VSCode and the integrated terminal to initialize, build, and run C# projects.
-   Print text and variables using `Console.Write`.

Requirements
------------

### Shell Scripts

-   Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
-   All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
-   All files should end with a new line.
-   The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
-   All files must be executable.

### C# Tasks

-   Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code.
-   All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `dotnet`.
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
-   All default C# files named `Program.cs` should be renamed to the name given in each task.
-   You do not need to know about namespaces and classes yet. Namespaces should be omitted in this project. The default names generated in `Program.cs` for class are okay.
-   Each C# task requires its own folder and `.csproj` file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct.
-   You do not need to push your `obj/` or `bin/` folders.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio Code. From there, you can work on each task in its own folder and use the integrated terminal to initialize, build, and run C# projects.

Make sure to read the `README.md` file in each task folder to understand the requirements and expected output of each task. Good luck!
