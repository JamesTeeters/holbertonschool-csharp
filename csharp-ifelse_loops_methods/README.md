C# - if/else, loops, functions
==============================

This repository contains a collection of C# tasks focused on if/else statements, loops, and functions. By completing these tasks, you will gain a solid understanding of these fundamental concepts in C# programming. At the end of this project, you will be able to explain and apply these concepts without relying on external resources.

Resources
---------

To successfully complete the tasks in this project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

-   [if-else (C# Reference)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/if-else)
-   [Control Statements - Loops](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/control-flow-statements#loops) (You do not need to know foreach yet)
-   [Methods (C# Reference)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods) (Read up to "Async Methods")
-   [Standard Numeric Format Strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings)
-   [Iteration Statements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/iteration-statements)

-   [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

-   Understand and utilize if, else if, and else statements
-   Implement while and for loops effectively
-   Utilize break and continue statements in control flow
-   Format numeric values using standard numeric format strings
-   Define and use methods within a class
-   Invoke public methods from another class
-   Differentiate between passing by reference and passing by value

Requirements
------------

### C# Tasks

-   Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
-   All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
-   A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
-   Rename all default C# files named `Program.cs` to the given task names
-   Do not include namespaces and classes in this project; they should be omitted
-   Each C# task should have its own folder and `.csproj` file
-   Push all task folders to your GitHub repository and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
-   Exclude the `obj/` and `bin/` folders from your repository
-   The provided `main.cs` files are examples for testing your functions but do not need to be pushed to your repo. We will use our own `main.cs` files for compilation, which may differ from the examples.

Note: This README provides an overview of the project and its requirements. Please refer to the individual task files for specific instructions and implementation details.
