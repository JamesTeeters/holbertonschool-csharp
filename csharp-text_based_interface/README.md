C# - Text-based Interface
=========================

This repository contains a project focused on creating a text-based interface in C#. The project aims to provide a practical understanding of building interactive console applications with text-based user interfaces (TUIs) using C#. By exploring this project, you will gain valuable insights into how to create intuitive and user-friendly command-line interfaces for your applications.

Project Overview
----------------

The C# - Text-based Interface project covers the following key areas:

-   Understanding the benefits and limitations of text-based user interfaces.
-   Implementing input/output handling in a console application.
-   Designing and structuring a menu-driven interface.
-   Handling user input and executing actions based on user selections.
-   Incorporating formatting and styling to enhance the visual appearance of the interface.

Through this project, you will gain practical knowledge and skills in building interactive text-based interfaces in C#, enabling you to create command-line applications that are easy to use and navigate.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By completing this project, you will be able to:

-   Understand the benefits and limitations of text-based user interfaces.
-   Implement input/output handling in a console application.
-   Design and structure a menu-driven interface.
-   Handle user input and execute actions based on user selections.

Project Structure
-----------------

The project is structured as follows:

1.  Console Application Basics: This section provides an introduction to console application basics in C#. It covers topics such as reading input from the user, displaying output to the console, and formatting console output.

2.  Menu-Driven Interface: In this section, you will learn how to design and implement a menu-driven interface. It covers techniques for displaying menus, handling user input, and executing actions based on user selections.

3.  User Input Validation: The User Input Validation section focuses on validating user input in a text-based interface. It covers techniques for enforcing input constraints and handling invalid input scenarios.

4.  Enhancing the Interface: This section explores techniques for enhancing the visual appearance of the text-based interface. It covers topics such as adding color, using ASCII art, and incorporating progress indicators.

Each section includes examples, exercises, and best practices to reinforce the concepts covered and provide hands-on experience.
